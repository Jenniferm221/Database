Exercises
Use the commands above to complete the following tasks, and submit the SQL statements. Real-world examples must be distinct from 
those used in the text.

1. List the commands for adding, updating, and deleting data.

A. The Commands for adding, updating and deleting data are :

	1. to ADD data to a table you use INSERT INTO 
	2. to UPDATE data to a table you use UPDATE
	3. to DELETE data from a table you use DELETE

2. Explain the structure for each type of command.

A. When using INSERT INTO, UPDATE or DELETE to modify an existing database, you need to be care ful that the structure around what you
are doing is correct so that your database has the correct results. 

	1. When looking to ADD data to a table you use INTERT INTO. you need to make sure to include the table name, and then the column 
	names that you want to inser into. You then need to use the keyword VALUES to indicate the values being entered into the cells
	followed by the information to be entered into the table. 
	
	ex. If you had a table called resturants, each resturant would have a specific ID, as well as the NAME of the resturant and maybe
		the type of resturant it was. 
		If our resturants were IHop, Applebees and Red Lobster, the INSERT statement to add these resurtants to the resturant table
		would look like this
		
		INSERT INTO resturants (id, name, type)
		VALUES
		(001, 'IHop', 'breakfast'),
		(002, 'Applebees', 'bar and grill'),
		(003, 'Red Lobster', 'seafood');

	2. When looking to UPDATE data in a table you need to make sure to include the table name, SET which indicates what values you want to
	change and WHERE which normally points to an ID and lets the database know what record you want to change the information for. 

		EX. Lets say you are a bookkeeper and a customer who was past due just paid their bill. Before the data base was updated it
		may look something like this

		id	name	amount 	
		003	SomeCo	$5,000			

		If payment was received this record would need to be updated. We can do this as follows

		UPDATE customer SET amount =0.00 WHERE id=003;

	3. When looking to DELETE data in a table you need to include the table name, as well ad WHERE you want to delete the data from. It is
	always a good idea when using DELETE to pick a column that has its own uniqe value for the WERE clause to make sure you dont delete any
	information accidentally. 


	EX. lets say we own a company that sells car parts and we no longer sell parts for Chevy cars and need to take them out of 
	our invintory. Our starting table called Parts would look like this

	id	description	part number	manufacturer 	vehicle type

	01	some car part	23035		Chevy		car
	02	some truck part	23135		Chevy		truck
	03	some car part	23235		Chevy		car
	04	some car part	23335		Honda		car

	to remove all of the Chevy Cars the code would look like this
	DELETE FROM parts WHERE manufacturer='Chevy' AND vehicle type = 'car';


3. What are some of the data types that can be used in tables? Give a real-world example of each type.

A. SQL data types can be broadly divided into following categories.

	1. Numeric data types such as int, tinyint, bigint, float, real etc.
		A real world example of this could be the quantity of items a store has in stock.
	2. Date and Time data types such as Date, Time, Datetime etc.
		A database could be set up to hold a place value for a date and time information was entered. 
		Another application for Date and Time datatypes could be if you were setting up a table and
		wanted to hold ancesrty information and include vital records that would show date and time 
		such as birth, marrage or death. 
	3. Character and String data types such as char, varchar, text etc.
		A real world example of this could be any typed information that your database would hold.
		so lets say you had a database that need to hold a customers name, the name catigory would be
		a string.


4. Decide how to create a new table to hold a list of people invited to a wedding dinner. The table needs to have first and last names, 
whether they sent in their RSVP, the number of guests they are bringing, and the number of meals (1 for adults and 1/2 for children).


- Which data type would you use to store each of the following pieces of information?

	First and last name.   text
	Whether they sent in their RSVP.   boolean
	Number of guests.  numeric
	Number of meals. numeric

- Write a command that creates the table to track the wedding dinner.

	CREATE TABLE wedding (
		id integer,
		first_name text,
		last_name text,
		RSVP_Received boolean,
		Number_of_Guests numeric (1,0),
		Number_of_meals numeric (1, 1)
);


- Write a command that adds a column to track whether the guest sent a thank you card.

	ALTER TABLE wedding ADD COLUMN thank_you_card_received boolean;

- You have decided to move the data about the meals to another table, so write a command to remove the column storing the number meals
   from the wedding table.
	
	AlTER TABLE wedding DROP COLUMN Number_of_meals;

- The guests will need a place to sit at the reception, so write a command that adds a column for table number.

	ALTER TABLE wedding ADD COLUMN table_number text;

- The wedding is over and we do not need to keep this information, so write a command that deletes the table numbers from the database.

	ALTER TABLE wedding DROP COLUMN table_number;

5. Write a command to create a new table to hold the books in a library with the columns ISBN, title, author, genre, publishing date, 
number of copies, and available copies.

CREATE TABLE books (
id integer,
ISBN numeric,
title tinytext,
author tinytext, 
genre tinytext, 
publishing_date date,
number_of_copies numeric,
available_copies numeric
);



- Find three books and add their information to the table.

A. 

Books I found- 

	Alice In Wonderland by Lewis Carroll ISBN 9788862777216 Genre Fiction Publishing date 11/26/1865 
	Scaredy Squirrel Makes a Friend by Melanie Watt ISBN 9781905117871 Genre Childrens Fiction Publishing date 03/01/2006
	Take a Chance on Me by Jill Mansell ISBN 9789021018232 Genre Romance Publishing Date 02/18/2010

Code to insert them into the book table 

INSERT INTO books (id, ISBN, title, author, genre, publishing_date, number_of_copies, available_copies)
VALUES
(001, 9788862777216, 'Alice In Wonderland','Lewis Carroll','Fiction', '1865-11-26', 5, 3),
(002, 9781905117871, 'Scaredy Squirrel Makes a Friend', 'Melanie Watt','Childrens Fiction', '2001-03-01', 2, 2),
(003, 9789021018232, 'Take a Chance on Me', 'Jill Mansell','Romance', '2010-02-18', 2, 1)
);


- Someone has just checked out one of the books. Change the number of available copies to 1 fewer.

UPDATE books SET available_copies= 1 WHERE id =002;

- Now one of the books has been added to the banned books list. Remove it from the table.

DELETE FROM books WHERE id=001;

6. Write a command to make a new table to hold spacecrafts. Information should include id, name, year launched, country of origin, 
a brief description of the mission, orbiting body, if it is currently operating, and its approximate miles from Earth. 
In addition to the table creation, provide commands that perform the following operations:

A.
CREATE TABLE spacecrafts (
  id	integer,
  name	text,
  mission_year	integer,
  country	text,
  description	varchar(100),
  orbiting	text,
  currently_operating	boolean,
  miles_from_earth	numeric(20,4)
  );

- Add three non-Earth-orbiting satellites to the table.

INSERT INTO spacecrafts ( id, name, mission_year, country, description, orbiting, currently_operating, miles_from_earth)

VALUES
(001, 'spaceship1', 2004, 'USA', 'mars expo', 'mars', 'yes', 234345.0342),
(002, 'spaceship2', 2018, 'Germany', 'Saturn expo', 'saturn', 'yes', 9034564.0021),
(003, 'spaceship3', 1943, 'Japan', 'Pluto Expo', 'Pluto', 'yes', 102938453.0345);

-Remove one of the satellites from the table since it has just crashed into the planet.

DELETE FROM spacecrafts WHERE id=003;

-Edit another satellite because it is no longer operating and change the value to reflect that.

UPDATE spacecrafts 
SET currently_operating ='no' WHERE id =001;

7. Write a command to create a new table to hold the emails in your inbox. This table should include an id, the subject line, 
the sender, any additional recipients, the body of the email, the timestamp, whether or not you have read the email, and the 
id of the email chain it's in. 

CREATE TABLE email ( 
  id 		integer,
subject 	text, 
sender 		varchar(40), 
additional_recipients 	varchar(100), 
body_of_email 		varchar(300), 
date_time 		timestamp, 
email_read 		boolean NOT null, 
email_chain_id integer 
);


Also provide commands that perform the following operations:

- Add three new emails to the inbox.

INSERT INTO email (id, subject, sender, additional_recipients, body_of_email, date_time, email_read, email_chain_id) 

VALUES 
(001, 'Follow up', 'jenniferm221@gmail.com', 'jenniferm221@gmail.com', 'Hello jennifer, wanted to follow up on our phone call', '2019-01-01 12:03:01', true , 234352 ),
( 002, 'hello', 'jenn.mclaughlin@outlook.com', 'someemail@aol.com', 'Hi Jenn!', '2018-12-27 01:09:12', false, 457412),
( 003, 'Update', 'test@yahoo.com', 'bestemail@hotmail.com', 'Here is an update for your recent order. Thank you for shopping with us', '2019-01-23 03:14:07', true, 532147);


-You deleted one of the emails, so write a command to remove the row from the inbox table.

DELETE FROM email WHERE id=003;


You started reading an email but just heard a crash in another room. Mark the email as unread before investigating the crash, 
so you can come back and read it later.

UPDATE email SET email_read=false WHERE id=001;
